 <h2>
  Before you Start 
 </h2>
 <p><br><br>To be a great clarinet player you must first have a want to play this amazing instrument. Do not just play it because I told you so. Play it because you <strong>know</strong> the clarinet is the best instrument for you to play.
 <br>To be a great clarinet player the world will remember you must first have to show these qualities; 
</p> 
<ul>
 <li>Determination- You have to be ready do be stopped and push on to achived your goals (in this case a song)</li>
 <li>Ready to Hear <strong>anything</strong>- When you are trying something new, you do not know what might come out of your clarinet </li>
 <li>The willingness to be corected- We all don't like making mistakes but when we do we have to acknowlege the comment and <strong>make your music better</strong>!!!</li>
 <li>Love of Music-You have to love music first, then you will have the determination to play anything!</li>
 <li>You got to have clairnet pride!- You have to love the instrument before up try to play a note!</li>
 </ul><br>
<h2>When You Get Your Clarinet Case</h2>
<p>
 <br>
 When you first get your clarinet case open it and take a good look at it. Then close it! You have <strong>no</strong> clue how to play the instrument and you might break all the reeds!!! Wait until a master jedi (a clarinet teacher) tells you to how to put together your clarinet to make something great (Or if you read onwards your questions will be answered)!
</p>
<h3>What is the Reed?</h3>
 <center><img src="http://media.wwbw.com/is/image/MMGS7/468271000939000-00-250x250.jpg"></center>
 <p>A clarinet reed is a small thin peice of wood (as you can see above) that is key to making a sound on the clarinet. In fact without this tiny piece of wood you would not be able to make a sound! This because the reed is the part of the instrument that vibrates. If you know your science, you should know that to make a sound there must be a vibration. To play the clarinet well you have to master the reed. Before you play the clarinet you have to check if your reed is crack, cripped or broken. If your reed is in one of those conditions you will be in deep trouble and not be able to play the clarinet. Not to worry, a clarinet player should have three reeds in good condition on hand just in case one of them breaks.</p>
 <p>When you start playing the clarinet the strength of the reed (how think it is) is very important. The stronger the strength of the reed is, the harder it is too play, but the better sound quality it will be. When you start off you should order and play with  1 or 1.5 strength reeds (you can find out the strength of your reed on the bottom of you reed or on your reed box.) Once you get better at playing clarinet you can start use 2 strength reeds. Pretty soon you will be using 3 strength and be a pro clarinet player!</p>
 <p>Here are some clarinet reed brands you can use:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Rico</li> 
  <li>Giardinelli</li>
  <li>Vandoren</li>
  <li>Legere</li>
 </ul>
<h2>The First Note(s)...</h2>
<p>Your first note will sound like a squeak. A really long squeak. This is when you only have the mouth peice, barrel (and reed) your clarinet (the more peices on your clarinet, deeper the sound whithout covering any holes) Once you can get the right embouchure you can play it well.</p>
<h3>Speaking of Embouchures...How do you to It?</h3>
<p>The embouchure for the clarinet is one of the most important part of playing the instrument. To do your embouchure correctly follow the steps below. Agian this will make a loud annoying sound. Use this power for good.</p>
<ol>
 <li>For beginners put together the mouth peice and the barrel to start with. Start licking or sucking your reed to get it wet. Note: if your reed is not wet it will not play.</li>
 <li>Put your reed on the mouth peice of the clarinet. Remember make it look like the picture next to this: <a href="http://www.the-clarinets.net/"><img src="http://www.hansonclarinets.com/Hanson_Clarinet_Company._Making_Music_in_Great_Britain./Assembly_files/Clcare06.jpg"></a> </li>
 <li>Tighten your ligature so that your reed is in place, but not way too tight.</li>
 <li>Press your lips in a blowing position. <b>DO NOT</b> just blow in to it. It will make a werid sound or squeak.</li> 
 <li>Put your teeth on the slanted part of the mouth peice. Do not press your teeth on the mouth peices <i>too</i> hard.</li>
 <li>Blow softly, do not blast on that thing like if your head was on fire be <i>calm</i> and <i>cool</i></li>
</ol>
<p>If you blow smoothy (when you start playing songs) you sure sound great!</p>
<h2>Back to your First Note(s)...</h2>
 <p>
 So when you play your first note with the right embouchure you might be a little disappointed with your sound. Do not lose hope! Do not give up! This is only the first note. You still have not put together your clarinet! So keep on being the determined person you are!
 Remember the famous quote from World War II: <center><img src="https://wtmcclendon.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/keep-calm-carry-on.jpeg" height="258px"></center>
 </p>
 <p>When you are ready, or when your clarinet teacher tells you, put together your instrument. This part is very important. You can break your clarinet in the process of putting it together (we will get to fixing your clarinet later) Remember the next steps when you first put it together. So you will have memorizied without any rise of breakage! </p>
 <ol>
  <li>Go back up to where it says to put together your mouth peice, reed and barrel do that first.</li>
  <li>Get the upper joint and push it in the end of the barrel</li>
  <li>Now be careful connect the bridge key to the lower joint. The bridge key can be break very easily and it is an essential part of your clarinet, so do be careful when you connect it.</li>
  <li>Lastly, connect the bell to the lower joint to finish the clarinet.</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Taking care of your Clarinet</h2>
 <p>Now you have your clarinet, you know how to do a correct embouchure and play a note or two. Now comes the imporant part-taking care of it! It is no use of having or play the clarinet without knowing how to care of it.One of the very important part of having a clarinet is to clean it every time you play it. The clarinet an elagent instrument, but it will lose it's style it you do not use it correctly. To clean it you have to use something call a swab (it comes with most clarinets). </p><center><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41p3tbqHmIL.jpg"></center> <p>This can be made out of cotton or silk (I prefer the silk version of this) either way it is made it severs the same purpose-to clean.</p>
 <p>To swab is about as simple as thinking. You just simply put the string in the mouth peice (without the reed of course) and run it through your clarinet a few times. This pervents nasty stuff from growing in your instrument.</p>
 <p>You should also put away your clarinet when you are done with it, you don not want anyone breaking it. Also you should not leave your amazing instrument on place that people might sit on or step on. Even though that might be a no brainer, accidents do happen and most of the time it is beacuse a simple mistake.<p>
 <p>The best rule of taking care of yout clarinet is really the simplest. <strong>Do not be silly with your clarinet</strong>. If you want to take care of your clarinet you must be responsible with it and not be goofing off and abusing your instrument. That is the key to enjoying your clarinet for years to come.</p>
