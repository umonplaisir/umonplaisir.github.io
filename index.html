 <h2>
  <i>Before you start </i>
 </h2>
 <p><br><br>To be a great clairnet player you must first have a want to play this amazing instrument. Do not just play it because I told you so. Play it because you <strong>know</strong> the clarinet is the best instrument for you to play
 <br>To be a great clarinet player thre world will remember you first have to show these qualities; 
</p> 
<li>Determined- You have to be ready do be stopped and push on to achived your goals (in this case a song)</li>
<li>Ready to Hear <strong>anything</strong>- When you are tryng something new, you do not know what might come out of your clarinet </li>
<li>The willingness to be corected- We all don't like making mistakes but when we do we have to acknowlege the comment and <strong>make your music better</strong>!!!</li>
<li>Love of Music-You have to love music first, then you will have the determination to play anthing!</li>
<li>You got to have clairnet pride!- You have to love the instrument before up try to play a note!</li><br><br>
<h2><i>When You Get Your Clarinet Case</i></h2>
<p>
 <br>
 When you first get your clarinet case open it and take a good look at it. Then close it! You have <strong>no</strong> clue how to play the instrument and you might break all the reeds!!! Wait until a master jedi (a clarinet teacher) Tells you to put together your clarinet to make something great.
 
</p>
<h2>The First Note...</h2>
<p>Your first note will sound like a squeak. A really long squeak. This is when you only have the mouth peice and the barrel your clarinet (the more peices on your clarinet, deeper the sound is) Once you can grt the right position </p>
